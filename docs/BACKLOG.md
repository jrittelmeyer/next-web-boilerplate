# Backlog — Forward (Watch + Tier 4 upgrade paths)

> **Forward-only backlog** (formerly `PHASE_3_IDEAS.md`). Phases 1–5 and every
> locally-buildable Tier-4 row are complete and pushed to main. Shipped-item detail is
> **not** kept here: the compact record is the build-progress table in
> [PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md), and the full per-item prose is in
> [archive/PHASE_HISTORY.md](archive/PHASE_HISTORY.md). The audits that seeded past
> backlogs live in [docs/archive/](archive/) (Phase B + the seven `/project-audit`
> scoring passes: 93 → 97.5 → 98.2 → 99.3 → 99.3 → 99.3 → 99.35/100). Everything below
> goes plan → sign-off → build. Don't reintroduce shipped-item entries here.

## Watch (no action now)

- **TypeScript 7** — **GA'd as `typescript@7.0.2` (2026-07-08)**, but a 2026-07-13 cutover
  attempt (owner-approved override of the age gate; repo undeployed → no prod risk) found it
  **not yet adoptable here.** TS 7's package IS the native **Go** compiler and **ships no JS
  Compiler API** — its `typescript` module exposes only `version`; `createProgram`/`readConfigFile`/
  `sys`/`transpileModule` are gone and there is no `lib/typescript.js` (the programmatic API moved
  to `./unstable/*`). So `next build` fails at its TS-detection step (Next 16 stable embeds the
  classic API). This is **known & expected**: every library-API consumer (Next, webpack loaders,
  Vue/Svelte/Astro/MDX/Angular) must stay on TS 6 until the stable programmatic API returns in
  **TS 7.1 (~Q4 2026)**. **Upstream moved 2026-07-10:** Next merged **experimental TS7 support
  into canary** ([#95639](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/95639) — detects TS7 and offers
  `experimental.useTypeScriptCli`, shelling out to the CLI instead of the JS API; auto-detect
  planned before stable), closing the tracking issue
  [#95490](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/95490) as completed
  ([#95633](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/95633) remains the discussion). Not in
  any stable 16.2.x as of 2026-07-15. The `tsc` CLI itself is clean and
  **~3.6× faster** (monorepo type-check 20.5s → 5.7s, cache-bypassed), so the win is real.
  **Re-gate: on TS7 support reaching a *stable* Next release** (`useTypeScriptCli` or its
  auto-detect successor) — potentially ahead of TS 7.1, since Next now shells to the CLI.
  (Mechanics learned: the pnpm age gate re-validates the whole lockfile on every `pnpm
  run`/frozen install, not just `pnpm install` — any early adoption needs a
  `minimumReleaseAgeExclude`.)
- **Maintenance-only** (Tier 3 **G**) — the honest "we're done" option: let Renovate drive
  deps, keep docs current, add steps as real needs surface. Standing state 2026-07-12 →
  2026-07-15; **SUPERSEDED 2026-07-15 by the path-to-100 program** (owner decision): the
  seven audit passes plateaued at 99.35 because the last 13 points sat behind won't-fix
  classifications, so each was re-litigated — all 13 proved recoverable
  ([archive/PATH_TO_100_2026-07-15.md](archive/PATH_TO_100_2026-07-15.md)). Maintenance-only
  resumes when the program's rows ship and a scoring pass verifies them.
- **e2e signup flake** — the `signUp`→`/dashboard` Playwright step is intermittently flaky
  (absorbed by `retries:2`, but it twice burned 2 of 3 CI attempts). **Not a code bug** — a
  fragile signup+redirect timing flow on modest runners. Harden **only if it ever turns a lane
  red**: bump that test's timeout, or wait on a network/cookie signal rather than only the URL.
- **Temporary security overrides (2026-07-15)** — three pnpm `overrides:` in
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml` remediate transitive-only Dependabot alerts with no upstream fix
  (`effect` 3.21.4 via uploadthing · `postcss` 8.5.15 via next's own pin · `esbuild` 0.25.12
  child-scoped via drizzle-kit). Remove each when its upstream moves — per-package removal
  conditions in [MAINTENANCE.md → Watch items](MAINTENANCE.md#watch-items-known-tracked-deliberately-not-done).

## Tier 4 — Future upgrade paths (documented, unscheduled)

> Each open row is a real direction, **opt-in / on real need** (the starter is
> feature-complete without them), and goes plan → sign-off → build. Shipped rows keep one
> strikethrough line in the table at the bottom — the record is the PROJECT_STATUS
> build-progress table + the doc in "See"; don't re-expand them here.
>
> **The open set, ordered** — the **path-to-100 program** (2026-07-15, owner-directed):
> 11 rows recovering the 13 audit points locked behind won't-fix/deferred classifications;
> per-row re-analysis, risk flags, and done-criteria live in
> [archive/PATH_TO_100_2026-07-15.md](archive/PATH_TO_100_2026-07-15.md) — don't duplicate
> them here. Sequenced breadth-first in four waves: **Wave 1 (B1)** five small universal
> fixes · **Wave 2 (B2)** magic link + i18n completion · **Wave 3 (B3)** bounce handling +
> opt-in OTel + CSP mode · **Wave 4 (B4)** per-org billing. The **TypeScript 7 cutover**
> stays outside the program (externally gated, costs no points; see Watch).

### Open rows

| Band | Area | Upgrade | Documented in | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | Uploads | **UT prod-callback runbook: the one-time live proof** (remaining half of program #4) | SERVICES.md → Uploadthing · VERIFICATION.md | 4a (`uploads.spec.ts`, keyless e2e) **shipped 2026-07-16** and the `UPLOADTHING_CALLBACK_URL` + tunnel runbook is **authored with source-verified mechanics** (installed 7.7.4: Effect ConfigProvider maps the env var; zero code change). Remaining: run it once live (cloudflared/ngrok quick tunnel → upload → callback POST through the tunnel → `uploads` row) + date the VERIFICATION.md box. **Blocked 2026-07-16: the agent sandbox denied opening a public tunnel** — needs the owner to allow it (settings rule), run the tunnel himself, or say which tunnel tool to use. Recovers the last Uploads +1 → 100. [Program #4](archive/PATH_TO_100_2026-07-15.md). S |
| B3 | Observability | **Opt-in OpenTelemetry** | SERVICES.md → Observability | OTel in `instrumentation.ts` behind `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (unset = today's exact behavior). **Risk: Sentry-SDK OTel coexistence** — the plan's core question; verify against a local collector. Recovers Obs +1 → 100. [Program #9](archive/PATH_TO_100_2026-07-15.md). M |
| B3 | Security | **`CSP_MODE=nonce` as a first-class mode** | SECURITY.md | Promote the verified nonce recipe to an env-gated mode (default stays static + `'unsafe-inline'`); opt-in CI lane e2e-verifies the nonce matrix. **Risk: proxy complexity; nonce pages render dynamic** (inherent). Recovers Security +1 → 100. [Program #10](archive/PATH_TO_100_2026-07-15.md). M/L |
| B4 | Payments | **Per-org billing** | SERVICES.md → Stripe | Org-scoped subscriptions: nullable `subscriptions.organizationId`, org-context checkout (owner/admin), webhook mapping, `hasOrgSubscription` gating, org-aware billing page; Stripe-CLI live-verify per the Phase-5 method. Seat-quantity billing explicitly out of scope. Recovers Payments +2 → 100. [Program #11](archive/PATH_TO_100_2026-07-15.md). L |
| B4 | Toolchain | **TypeScript 7 cutover** (outside the program) | STACK.md | **Blocked on TS7 support reaching a stable Next release** (experimental in canary since 2026-07-10; TS 7.1 ~Q4 2026 restores the JS API for the rest of the toolchain) — full detail in Watch above. Costs no audit points. |

### Shipped (strikethrough record — full rows in the PROJECT_STATUS table + archive/PHASE_HISTORY)

| Band | Upgrade | Shipped | See |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| B2 | ~~i18n full-surface message coverage~~ — en/es catalogs extended to every `[locale]` surface (identical key trees, en byte-identical); the six `toLocale*` sites → A32 named formats (+ `dateOnly`); i18n e2e extended (es demo chrome + signed-in es date spot-check); program row #7, Wave 2 complete. | 2026-07-16 | I18N.md · PROJECT_STATUS Path-to-100 · #7 |
| B2 | ~~Wire magic-link sign-in (env-gated)~~ — `magicLink()` gated on email config, safe tuple position; capture-seam e2e (second webServer) + live :3100 send proof; program row #6, first Wave-2 row shipped. | 2026-07-16 | AUTH.md → Magic link · PROJECT_STATUS Path-to-100 · #6 |

| B1 | ~~Wire the `persist` recipe to a real slice~~ — `ui-store` persists `sidebarOpen` hydration-safely (`skipHydration` + `<StoreRehydration/>`); unit tests pin the partialize/no-storage subtleties, `state.spec.ts` proves reload persistence with zero hydration errors; program row #2. | 2026-07-16 | STATE.md → Middleware decision · PROJECT_STATUS Path-to-100 · #2 |
| B1 | ~~Admin-gate `reindexPosts`~~ — `requireAdmin()` in the action (P1-2 demo decision superseded) + the `/search` page hides the button for non-admins; live-verified end-to-end incl. the psql-promote → fresh-role-read loop; program row #5. | 2026-07-16 | SERVICES.md → Meilisearch · PROJECT_STATUS Path-to-100 · #5 |
| B1 | ~~Wire the dead-letter queue~~ — every queue gets `deadLetter: "failed-jobs"` (+ `updateQueue` convergence for pre-existing DBs) with a watched consumer (console + env-gated Sentry via the app's reused DSN); exhausted-job → DLQ integration-tested on real Postgres; program row #3. | 2026-07-16 | SERVICES.md → Jobs (dead-letter) · PROJECT_STATUS Path-to-100 · #3 |
| B1 | ~~Enable CodeQL~~ — `ENABLE_CODEQL` flipped the day the repo went public (code scanning is free on public repos); the pre-publish git-history secrets scan happened as part of the launch. | 2026-07-14 | DEPLOYMENT.md → CI/CD · PROJECT_STATUS launch row |
| B3 | ~~Production sending domain + deliverability~~ — a real verified domain + SPF/DKIM/DMARC recipe; deliverability + the hop-2 email-change delivery gap (open since 2026-07-05) proven/closed live.

Vercel/Railway/VPS paths stay authored. | 2026-07-13 | [DEPLOYMENT.md → Fly.io](context/DEPLOYMENT.md#flyio-worked-runbook) · [VERIFICATION.md](VERIFICATION.md) Phase 6 |
| B2 | ~~Stripe Phase-5 live-verify~~ — **COMPLETE in test mode** (checkout → webhook → row + idempotency; customer reuse; billing portal; test-clock dunning; webhook 400/503/429; A13 cancel-on-delete live). Doc-only close. | 2026-07-13 | [VERIFICATION.md](VERIFICATION.md) Phase 5 |
