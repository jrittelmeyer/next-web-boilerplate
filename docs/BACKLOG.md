# Backlog — Forward (Watch + Tier 4 upgrade paths)

> **Forward-only backlog** (formerly `PHASE_3_IDEAS.md`). Phases 1–5 and every
> locally-buildable Tier-4 row are complete and pushed to main. Shipped-item detail is
> **not** kept here: the compact record is the build-progress table in
> [PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md), and the full per-item prose is in
> [archive/PHASE_HISTORY.md](archive/PHASE_HISTORY.md). The audits that seeded past
> backlogs live in [docs/archive/](archive/) (Phase B + the nine `/project-audit`
> scoring passes: 93 → 97.5 → 98.2 → 99.3 → 99.3 → 99.3 → 99.35 → 100.0 → 100.0/100). Everything below
> goes plan → sign-off → build. Don't reintroduce shipped-item entries here.

## Watch (no action now)

- **TypeScript 7** — **GA'd as `typescript@7.0.2` (2026-07-08)**, but a 2026-07-13 cutover
  attempt (owner-approved override of the age gate; repo undeployed → no prod risk) found it
  **not yet adoptable here.** TS 7's package IS the native **Go** compiler and **ships no JS
  Compiler API** — its `typescript` module exposes only `version`; `createProgram`/`readConfigFile`/
  `sys`/`transpileModule` are gone and there is no `lib/typescript.js` (the programmatic API moved
  to `./unstable/*`). So `next build` fails at its TS-detection step (Next 16 stable embeds the
  classic API). This is **known & expected**: every library-API consumer (Next, webpack loaders,
  Vue/Svelte/Astro/MDX/Angular) must stay on TS 6 until the stable programmatic API returns in
  **TS 7.1 (~Q4 2026)**. **Upstream moved 2026-07-10:** Next merged **experimental TS7 support
  into canary** ([#95639](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/95639) — detects TS7 and offers
  `experimental.useTypeScriptCli`, shelling out to the CLI instead of the JS API; auto-detect
  planned before stable), closing the tracking issue
  [#95490](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/95490) as completed
  ([#95633](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/95633) remains the discussion). Not in
  any stable 16.2.x as of 2026-07-15. The `tsc` CLI itself is clean and
  **~3.6× faster** (monorepo type-check 20.5s → 5.7s, cache-bypassed), so the win is real.
  **Re-gate: on TS7 support reaching a *stable* Next release** (`useTypeScriptCli` or its
  auto-detect successor) — potentially ahead of TS 7.1, since Next now shells to the CLI.
  (Mechanics learned: the pnpm age gate re-validates the whole lockfile on every `pnpm
  run`/frozen install, not just `pnpm install` — any early adoption needs a
  `minimumReleaseAgeExclude`.)
- **Maintenance-only** (Tier 3 **G**) — the honest "we're done" option: let Renovate drive
  deps, keep docs current, add steps as real needs surface. Standing state 2026-07-12 →
  2026-07-15; superseded 2026-07-15 by the path-to-100 program (owner decision;
  [archive/PATH_TO_100_2026-07-15.md](archive/PATH_TO_100_2026-07-15.md)); **RESUMED
  2026-07-17** — the program shipped all 11 rows and the eighth scoring pass verified it
  at **100.0/100** ([archive/PROJECT_AUDIT_2026-07-17.md](archive/PROJECT_AUDIT_2026-07-17.md)).
  Near-term owner calendar: Monday 2026-07-20 (scheduled Renovate batch, ~36 minors —
  triage per PR at open time). The 7 approved majors merged 2026-07-18;
  typescript-v7 stays held per the TS7 gate.
- **e2e signup flake** — the `signUp`→`/dashboard` Playwright step is intermittently flaky
  (absorbed by `retries:2`, but it twice burned 2 of 3 CI attempts). **Not a code bug** — a
  fragile signup+redirect timing flow on modest runners. Harden **only if it ever turns a lane
  red**: bump that test's timeout, or wait on a network/cookie signal rather than only the URL.
- **Temporary security overrides (2026-07-15)** — three pnpm `overrides:` in
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml` remediate transitive-only Dependabot alerts with no upstream fix
  (`effect` 3.21.4 via uploadthing · `postcss` 8.5.15 via next's own pin · `esbuild` 0.25.12
  child-scoped via drizzle-kit). Remove each when its upstream moves — per-package removal
  conditions in [MAINTENANCE.md → Watch items](MAINTENANCE.md#watch-items-known-tracked-deliberately-not-done).

## Tier 4 — Future upgrade paths (documented, unscheduled)

> Each open row is a real direction, **opt-in / on real need** (the starter is
> feature-complete without them), and goes plan → sign-off → build. Shipped rows keep one
> strikethrough line in the table at the bottom — the record is the PROJECT_STATUS
> build-progress table + the doc in "See"; don't re-expand them here.
>
> **The path-to-100 program** (2026-07-15, owner-directed) — 11 rows recovering the 13
> audit points locked behind won't-fix/deferred classifications (per-row re-analysis in
> [archive/PATH_TO_100_2026-07-15.md](archive/PATH_TO_100_2026-07-15.md)) — **shipped all
> 11 build rows 2026-07-16 → 17** (strikethrough table below), closed the last remainder
> (**#4b**, the one-time live Uploadthing tunnel proof, 2026-07-17), and was **VERIFIED
> at 100.0/100 by the 2026-07-17 scoring pass**
> ([archive/PROJECT_AUDIT_2026-07-17.md](archive/PROJECT_AUDIT_2026-07-17.md)). The
> **TypeScript 7 cutover** stays outside the program (externally gated, costs no
> points; see Watch). Open row: the TS7 cutover.

### Open rows

| Band | Area | Upgrade | Documented in | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B4 | Toolchain | **TypeScript 7 cutover** (outside the program) | STACK.md | **Blocked on TS7 support reaching a stable Next release** (experimental in canary since 2026-07-10; TS 7.1 ~Q4 2026 restores the JS API for the rest of the toolchain) — full detail in Watch above. Costs no audit points. |
| B1 | Docs-in-code | **M-1: two stale `postgres:16` comments → `postgres:18`** (`packages/db/vitest.config.ts` · `packages/jobs/vitest.integration.config.ts`) | [archive/PROJECT_AUDIT_2026-07-18.md](archive/PROJECT_AUDIT_2026-07-18.md) | Comment-only; the 07-18 postgres-18 merge updated CI + docs but missed these two in-code mentions. Ride it on any next code-touching change. |
| B1 | On-ramp / kit | **Intake-drop convention for `/project-init`** — template half: seed a committed `docs/intake/` (README: drop planning docs here → run `/project-init`) + a GETTING_STARTED sentence + init-app kept-list mention; kit half: `init.intakeDir` adapter field (default `docs/intake/`), intake enumeration in project-init §1, raw docs → `docs/archive/product-intake/` in the inception commit after brief sign-off (prevents a second source of truth beside `PRODUCT.md`) | [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md#starting-from-an-idea-run-project-init) | Direction owner-approved 2026-07-18; **build after the first real derived-project inception run (in flight) supplies lessons.** Kit half edits an ai-dev-kit clone → re-install (`--dest`), never the installed copies. Verified: init-app `--slim`'s delete list doesn't touch `docs/intake/`. Sibling convention shipped 2026-07-19: `intake/source/` (gitignored **code** drop for `/project-adopt`) stays separate — committed planning docs vs never-committed source. Plan → sign-off before building. |
| B1 | On-ramp / kit | **project-adopt live trial (program step 3)** — drive the full `/project-adopt` flow on a fresh consumer copy against a small real OSS app (the Potluck-trial pattern): intake (drop-dir + git-URL forms) → survey/parity contract → disposition map → question round → brief + migration map → regenerated docs through the sign-off gate; mend the skill from lessons (kit patch release) | [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md#starting-from-an-existing-app-run-project-adopt) | Steps 1+2 (skill, kit 0.6.0 + template wiring) shipped 2026-07-19. Skill mends edit an ai-dev-kit clone → re-install (`--dest`), never the installed copies. Plan → sign-off before running. |

### Shipped (strikethrough record — full rows in the PROJECT_STATUS table + archive/PHASE_HISTORY)
